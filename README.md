# 32-bit Pipelined RISC-V Processor

This repository contains the SystemVerilog implementation of a 32-bit processor that executes the RISC-V (RV32I) base instruction set. The project is developed as part of the CSD course.

## Project Overview

The primary goal is to design, implement, and verify a functional RISC-V CPU. The project begins with a foundational single-cycle processor to verify the core datapath and control logic (Module 1). It then evolves into an advanced 5-stage pipelined processor to improve instruction throughput, complete with hazard detection and forwarding (Module 2).

## Architecture Specifications

This section defines the processor's behavior from a programmer's perspective, adhering to the RISC-V standard.

### Base ISA
The processor will implement the **RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set**, Version 2.1. This defines a 32-bit architecture with 32-bit general-purpose registers and a set of 47 base instructions.

### Instruction Formats
The processor decodes and executes all standard RV32I instruction formats: R, I, S, B, U, and J.


### Register File
* **General-Purpose Registers (GPRs):** 32 registers (`x0`-`x31`), each 32 bits wide.
* **Special GPR:** `x0` is a constant, hardwired to the value zero.
* **Special-Purpose Registers:** A single 32-bit **Program Counter (PC)** that holds the address of the instruction to be fetched.

### Memory and Address Space
* **Address Space:** The processor can access a flat, byte-addressable address space of **$2^{32}$ bytes (4 GiB)**.
* **Endianness:** The system is **Little-Endian**.
* **Cache:** No cache hierarchy is implemented in the base design.

### Input/Output (I/O)
I/O operations are handled via **Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO)**. A portion of the address space is reserved for peripheral devices.

## Design Specifications (Microarchitecture)

This section describes the internal hardware implementation of the processor.

### Pipeline Structure
The advanced version of the processor implements a classic **5-stage RISC pipeline** to maximize instruction throughput.

1.  **IF:** Instruction Fetch
2.  **ID:** Instruction Decode & Register Read
3.  **EX:** Execute / Address Calculation
4.  **MEM:** Memory Access
5.  **WB:** Write Back

### Hazard Management
* **Data Hazards:** Resolved primarily through a **Forwarding Unit** (bypassing) to send results from the EX/MEM stages back to the EX stage. A **Hazard Detection Unit** stalls the pipeline for one cycle on a load-use hazard.
* **Control Hazards:** Resolved using a **predict-not-taken** scheme. The pipeline is flushed (instructions are invalidated) when a branch is taken.

### Clocking and HDL
* **Target Clock Frequency:** The design targets a synthesis frequency of **50 MHz**.
* **Clocking Scheme:** A **single, synchronous clock** drives the CPU core and all memory interfaces.
* **Hardware Description Language (HDL):** The entire design is coded in **SystemVerilog**.
